ExpresssJS Notes

Unopinionated minimalist Framework that works on top of Node JS
Its helps server and routing
Its asynchronous and Singloe threaded

Set up
npm install -g express (Installs expressJS)

npm install -g express-generator (installs express-generator)

express(dowloads the boilerplate project)

Jade is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node and browsers. 

Set up express server

npm init at folder level to create the package.json
keep hitting "enter" until "Yes" and then package.json shoudl be created
create app.js and enter below lines

var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var port = 8000;
app.listen(port);
console.log('Express Server Started...');

change the index.js to app.js in package.json and then run 
npm install --save express

this will update the package.json with express dependency and its version

now run 
node app.js OR node app--- this should start the node server with message as express server started as discussed above
npm install -g nodemon

nodemon automatically restarts the server after you make the changes to file(s) and save them


** Very imp after installing the nodemon....no need to use node app instead use below command
nodemon app

** Try changing something like console log in app.js

Morgan is a middleware that logs the data into console.
Bodyparse uses request.body to retrive data from front end
